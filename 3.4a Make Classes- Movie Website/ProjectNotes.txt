Project Specification

By the end of this stage, you will be able to use other people's existing code in your own programming projects. You will write code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailer.

Project Submission
You will write code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailer.

How will I complete this project?

If you haven't already, install Python
Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py - this module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
Get started with this helpful guide.

For this stage, you will need to submit a zip of your project files saved as movie_website.zip. Your zip should include three Python files: media.py, entertainment_center.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py. Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric. If you cannot see the image below, go to the project rubrics page here.
