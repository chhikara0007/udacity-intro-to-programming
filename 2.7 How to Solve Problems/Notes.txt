How to Solve Problems:
1. Figure out what the inputs are
  - dates in day, month, and year (integers)
      (year1, month1, day1, year2, month2, day2)
  - second date not before first (no time travel)

2. Figure out what the outputs are
  - return a number (days between first and second date)
  
3. Solve the Problem
  - Pseudocode: 
    days = days_in_month1 - day1
    month1 += 1
    while month1 < month2:
      month1 += 1
    days += day2
    while year1 < year2:
      days += days in year1
