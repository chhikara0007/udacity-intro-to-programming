Code a Fill-in-the-Blanks Quiz

You've built a Mad-Libs game with some help from Sean. Now you'll work on your own game to practice your 
skills and demonstrate what you've learned.

For this project, you'll be building a fill-in-the-blanks quiz. Your quiz will prompt a user with a sentence 
containing several blanks. The user should then be asked to fill in each blank appropriately to complete the 
sentence. This can be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary!

Note: Your game will have to accept user input so, like the Mad Libs generator, you won't be able to run it 
using Sublime's Build feature. Instead you'll need to run the program in Terminal or IDLE. Refer to Work Session 
5 if you need a refresher on how to do this.

Once you've created the game you should submit your Python file (named fill-in-the-blanks.py). Your project 
reviewer will review and provide feedback on two aspects of your submission: the game itself and the Python 
code you've written.

In the Downloadables section below, you'll find a starter code file (fill-in-the-blanks.py) to help you get going. 
We've also given you a file called fill-in-the-blanks.pyc which is a working version of the project. A .pyc file is a 
Python file that has been translated into "byte code". This means the code will run the same as the original .py 
file, but if you open it in Sublime it won't look like Python code! You can run it just like a regular Python file to 
see how your code should behave.
