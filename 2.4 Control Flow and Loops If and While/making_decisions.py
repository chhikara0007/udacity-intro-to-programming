# Lesson 2.4: Making Decisions - If Statements

# We'll often write programs that need to make comparisons between values.
# We can do comparisons just like we do in math with the < and > signs.
# We can also do equality comparisons with != (not equal) and ==.
# Comparisons always return a Boolean value (either True or False).
